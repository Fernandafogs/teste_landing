# Project Title: 
Challenge | Frontend Developer

## Description:
The challenge consists of developing the layout for a landing page with a product grid and a newsletter form. Your main objective is to turn this layout into a functional page.
The layout has been implemented according to the provided mock. The mock contains the layout structure and all the page styles.
To populate the page with product information, a paginated API has been consulted. Each page retrieved from the API contains information for 8 products and a link to the next page.

For each product returned by the API, a product card with its respective information has been created in the product grid.
By clicking the 'More products here!' button, the next page of the API can be fetched, generating an additional 8 products in the existing grid below the products loaded by the initial request.
The form fields are also validated according to their content.
